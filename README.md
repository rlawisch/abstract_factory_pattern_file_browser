# Abstract Factory Pattern example - Command line file browser

This project is a simple file browser implementation to demonstrate the encapsulation provided by the [Abstract Factory pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_factory_pattern). It can navigate through directories, list the current working directory and create, move, rename and delete directories and files.
It is made in Python 3.10 with 0 dependencies to install. Running is as simple as `python3 src/main.py`.

Pull requests with new features, refactors, better/more complete implementations, exception handling and/or better coverage of edge cases are very welcome!
